All your projects on github should include a README.md file. For this milestone all it needs is:

Short description of what you attempted to build
I built a game in unity. The game is a first person shooter type game. I essentially followed the tutorials that unity provided that helped me modify the game to my own liking. I added a room to the game and moved some level objects. I learned how to alter appearances of specific objects, such as the object's color and shape.


Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
I worked by myself.


What you learned
I learned the basics of unity. Most importantly, I learned about the basic layout of unity and how to create objects. I learned about prefabs. 

How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
This hack a thing relates to my possible project because unity is one of the softwares that people use the most for developing VR applications.


What didnâ€™t work
Unfortunately, I was unable to do a VR tutorial, because I needed to have an oculus headset. I also had a lot of glitches with unity on my computer. I tried running unity on my desktop macbook and the program shutdown my computer. Additionally, sometimes I was unable to clikc buttons without having to restart the program a couple of times. Also when I tried to build/publish my game via webGL, it kept crashing. So, I gave up on that.
